# Modeling population dynamics of the Aedes aegypti mosquito (CUDA version)

We present a spatially explicit agent-based model for *Ae. aegypti* mosquito populations.
We modeled human social behavior by including a set of parameters that mimics different human reactions in relation to water container discard campaigns.
The model was programmed in parallel using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to allow the increase in system size without losing performance and efficiency.
